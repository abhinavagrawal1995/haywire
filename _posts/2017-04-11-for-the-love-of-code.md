excerpt: Coding, I believe, is an artform

What do you imagine when I say “artist”? What image comes up in your mind when I say a “creative” person? A poet? Maybe a painter, or maybe a musician. But who decides what art is? Why do we limit the definition of creativity to these few areas?
Take any contemporary movie that discusses the debate between arts and science. It features a doctor/engineer who wanted to pursue arts but couldn't for whatsoever reasons. Why do we automatically assume that these fields are the exact opposite of what creativity?

Coding is one such example. When you think of hobbies that require inspiration, imagination or creativity, this would certainly not be one of the contenders on that list. But think about it. An artist has colors and instruments, a programmer has his favorite hardware and languages. You can write a generic piece of code from a textbook that would meet the requirements. OR, you could find the inspiration to find the exact fit. The optimal solution, tailor-made for that problem. A solution that solicits a level of satisfaction that makes you giddy with happiness. You can read it like a poem and watch it work like a perfectly synchronized orchestra. To me, coding is an artform. Let no one tell you otherwise.
