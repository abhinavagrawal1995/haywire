_Why do we write?_ Why do we feel the need to force our emotions to flow out in the permutations and combinations of 26 simple letters? To try and tame the flurry of thoughts swirling around in our head, for fleeting moments, just so we can channel them out of our body, embodied by drops of ink on a piece of paper?
Sometimes it's to broadcast a message to people, sometimes it's meant for someone in particular, and other times? Other times its meant for someone a lot closer to home. For yourself. Because when those muddled thoughts start feeling so alien that you feel like a guest in your own head, the gift of language comes to your rescue. The letters prance in like knights trying to tame the wild thoughts wreaking havoc in your mind, and ride through your quill all the way till they finally come to rest on that diminutive sheet of paper. 

And then you read them. Silently. Almost as if they were written by a stranger. And you realize, that maybe it really is. That maybe it's true that it's not you whose thoughts you're hearing. It's the cries of the little creature sitting behind the controls to a vehicle you call your body. And you're just a spectator with the illusion of control. And words are your only outlet to the real world, the only way to let your presence be known. And maybe the only way to communicate with the guy in the driver's seat. To communicate with your _self_.
